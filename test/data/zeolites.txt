Zeolites are a group of chemically related mineral substances that contain mainly hydrated aluminum and silicon compounds. They occur naturally in volcanic rock and ashes and are also formulated synthetically. Zeolites are marketed as dietary supplements for autism, diarrhea, herpes, hangover, to balance body pH, and as a heavy-metal detoxifier, immunomodulator, and antioxidant.

Industrial and agricultural applications include their use as additives in gravel, detergents, and animal feed, in water and air purifiers, and in some personal care products. Benefits of using zeolites in animal feed include increased mineral utilization (1), reduction of heavy metals-induced anemia (2), and reduction of aflatoxin toxicity (3). However, none of these benefits are applicable to humans. In addition, this use has raised concerns about accumulated tissue aluminum in treated livestock (4) vis-a-vis the known link of aluminum to several morbidities including Alzheimer’s disease (5) (6). Generally, the various forms of zeolite are not significantly toxic in acute, short-term oral, or parenteral toxicity studies in animals. However, inhalation toxicity is readily demonstrated (7), and erionite, a type of airborne fibrous zeolite, has been associated with high incidence of malignant mesothelioma (8) (9) (10) (11), and geologic occurrences of erionite are emerging as a concern for respiratory illness in the United States.

Zeolites have limited use in medicine as an external hemostatic dressing for trauma-related injuries (12), potential for controlled drug delivery, as a suspending agent, or for use in cardiopulmonary bypass and hemodialysis procedures (13) (14) (15). A small pilot study sponsored by the manufacturer of a proprietary oral zeolite supplement in immunodeficient patients suggests some immunomodulatory effects (16), and zeolite formulations reduced symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (32) (33) and decreased fracture risk in osteoporotic patients (34). In an Alzheimer’s mouse model, zeolite reduced oxidative damage and plaque generation (17).

Animal studies suggest that micronized zeolite may have anticancer benefits (18) (19); and ameliorates malignant mesothelioma caused by asbestos toxicity (31). Preliminary data suggest benefits of zeolite formulations, used as adjuncts to standard treatment, in reducing symptoms of neuroendocrine tumor-related diarrhea (30); and chemo-induced peripheral neuropathy (34).

Zeolites are hygroscopic compounds with a fine porous cage-like structure that allows for its ion-exchanging, adsorbent, anticaking, chelating, and desiccant characteristics (22) (23). Its ion-exchanging properties may alter the ionic composition, pH and buffering capacity of the gastrointestinal tract under conditions of overexposure (22).

Zeolite controls bleeding by absorbing water from the hemorrhage site through an exothermic reaction which supports the concentration of coagulation factors and platelets, causing clot formation (12). Zeolite pH buffering effects also adsorb nitrosamines in acidic solution (24), leading to unsubstantiated claims that it could remove carcinogenic substances in the stomach.

In vitro studies indicate that micronized zeolite inhibits protein kinase B, induces expression of tumor suppressor proteins (19), and limits reactive oxygen species effects (15). In animal studies, it reduced metastasis and increased the effect of doxorubicin due to its antioxidant properties (18). Zeolites may also have both immunosuppressive and immunostimulating effects, causing a decline of GM-CFU in the bone marrow (25), but also increasing graft-versus-host (GvH) reaction (26). Zeolite can affect brain serotonergic receptor activities of mammary carcinoma-bearing mice (27), but the clinical implications for humans is unclear. Zeolite supplementation did not prolong survival in tumor-bearing animals (25).

Special Point: A company filed a U.S. patent application in 2001 for a synthesized form of zeolite as a cancer drug (20). Data submitted were based on in vitro, plant, and animal studies. The patent specified that the substance must be injected directly into the tumor, which rules out any benefits by oral route.
