Ghana,
[a]
 officially the Republic of Ghana, is a country in West Africa. It lies adjacent to the Gulf 
of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean to the south, sharing a border with Ivory Coast (Côte 
d'lvoire) in the west, Burkina Faso in the north, and Togo in the east. Ghana covers an area of 
239,567 km
2
 (92,497 sq mi), spanning diverse ecologies, from coastal savannas to tropical 
rainforests. With nearly 35 million inhabitants, Ghana is the second-most populous 
country in West Africa. The capital and largest city is Accra; other 
significant cities include Tema, Kumasi, Sunyani, Ho, Cape Coast, Techiman, Tamale, 
and Sekondi-Takoradi. 
The earliest kingdoms to emerge in Ghana were Bonoman in the south and the Kingdom of 
Dagbon in the north, with Bonoman existing in the area during the 11th century.
[7][8]
 The Ashanti 
Empire and other Akan kingdoms in the south emerged over the centuries.

 Beginning in the 
15th century, the Portuguese Empire, followed by other European powers, contested the area 
for trading rights, until the British ultimately established control of the coast by the 19th century. 
Following more than a century of colonial resistance, the current borders of the country took 
shape, encompassing four separate British colonial territories: Gold Coast, Ashanti, 
the Northern Territories, and British Togoland. These were unified as an independent dominion 
within the Commonwealth of Nations. On 6 March 1957 Ghana became the first colony in Sub-
Saharan Africa to achieve sovereignty—that is, gain independence.
[10][11][12]
 Under 
President Kwame Nkrumah, it became influential in decolonisation efforts and the Pan-African 
movement.
[13][14]
 
Ghana is a multi-ethnic country with diverse linguistic and religious groups;
[15]
 while 
the Akan are the largest ethnic group, they constitute a plurality. 
Most Ghanaians are Christians (71.3%); almost a fifth are Muslims; a tenth practice traditional 
faiths or report no religion.
[3]
 Ghana is a unitary constitutional democracy led by a president who 
is head of state and head of government.
[16]
 For political stability in Africa, Ghana ranked 
seventh in the 2012 Ibrahim Index of African Governance and fifth in the 2012 Fragile States 
Index. It has maintained since 1993 one of the freest and most stable governments on the 
continent, and it performs relatively well in healthcare, economic growth, and human 
development,
[13][17]
 so that it has a significant influence in West Africa and Africa as a 
whole.

 Ghana is highly integrated in international affairs, being a founding member of 
the Non-Aligned Movement and the African Union, and a member of the Economic Community 
of West African States, the Group of 24 and the Commonwealth of Nations
